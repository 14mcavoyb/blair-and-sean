      <h2> What is the celebration agenda?</h2>
      <p> Our wedding celebration is just that - a celebration. No formal ceremony, just food, drinks, music and festivities! 
        <br>Arrive at 6pm to settle in with a drink, quick thank you's and toasts at 6:30, and a buffet-style dinner at 7. 
        <br>Our open bar and DJ will run from 6pm to 10pm.</p>
      
      <h2> What should I wear?</h2>
         <p>Really, anything you want is completely fine, just look nice for our pictures! 
         <br>Khakis and button-downs are great, no ties or jackets required. <br>Dresses are great, gowns and heels not required.</p>
     
    <h2> Where should I stay?</h2>
      <p>We are booking a block of rooms at The Omni Hotel on the downtown mall.<br> It is walking distance (0.2 miles along the pedestrian mall) from the venue.
        <br> There are also plenty of other options within walking distance to the venue, so please feel free to browse!</p>
      
      
      <h2> If I need help with something, who should I call?</h2>
      <p>Shannon McAvoy (Blair's sister) - 540-905-9775 <br> or <br> Steven Kunst (Sean's brother)</p>
